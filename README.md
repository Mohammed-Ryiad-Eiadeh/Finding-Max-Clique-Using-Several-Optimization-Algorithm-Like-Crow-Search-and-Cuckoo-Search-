# This is a repository of two research papers about finding the max clique in dense graphs.
The Max clique problem is a well-known combinatorial challenge that identifies the largest fully connected subgraph within network structures. Being NP-Complete, solving it precisely is computationally intensive. Approximation algorithms have offered reasonable solutions. This study introduces a new method, the Improved Binary Cuckoo Search Algorithm (IBCSA) with Binary Jaya Optimizer (BJO), which integrates Crow Search and Jaya algorithms. IBCSA-BJO incorporates various techniques such as Opposition-Based Learning, transfer functions, LÃ©vy flight, mutation, Xor, 1-point crossover, and a repairing method, along with a fitness function. These enhancements aim to diversify the initial population, improve search capabilities, and prevent local optima traps. Transfer functions convert continuous values to binary, and the repairing method corrects infeasible solutions. Evaluations against benchmark problems demonstrate that IBCSA-BJO presents a promising alternative to current state-of-the-art approaches.
