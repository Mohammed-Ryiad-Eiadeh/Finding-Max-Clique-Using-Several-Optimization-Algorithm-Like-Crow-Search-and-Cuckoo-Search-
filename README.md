Abstract:
Finding the max clique is a common combinatorial problem in networking especially in Social Network (SN). It 
aims to demonstrate the largest complete subgraph on various network structure which can be served as criminal 
groups detector. This problem belongs to NP-Complete class problems, therefore, utilizing exact method may 
provide the optimal solution, yet it is very expensive due time and space complexity. Recently approximation 
approaches like heuristics and metaheuristics have proved that they could achieve reasonable results with a 
reasonable resources consumption. In this study, we proposed a novel approach combined Crow Search Algorithm 
(CSA), Cuckoo Search (CS) with some improvement techniques: Opposition Based Learning (OBL), mutation, 
Xor, 1-point crossover. And few indispensable processes: Transfer Function (TF), Repairing Method (RM), Fitness 
Function (F). The improvement methods were used to increase the initial population variety and attempt to avoid 
the trap of local minima. And the necessary methods were used to convert CSA and CS to binary versions, convert 
the infeasible solutions to feasible ones, and evaluate each solution respectively. The proposed model IBCSA-BCS 
was evaluated over 26 test benchmarks problems and compared with other algorithms to measure itsâ€™ efficiency. 
Statistical analysis based on Friedman and Wilcoxon test proved that our approach could be employed as a good 
alternative to tackle the complication of finding max clique in dens graphs.
