# This is a repository of two research papers about finding the max clique in dense graphs.
Max clique is a common combinatorial problem demonstrates the 
largest complete subgraph on network structures. Max clique is an NP-Complete 
problem, which means solving it using exact algorithm is very expensive. 
Approximation algorithms have proved that they could achieve reasonable 
solutions. This paper proposed a novel approach based on Crow Search and Jaya 
algorithms called Improved Binary Cuckoo Search Algorithm (BHA) with 
Binary Jaya Optimizer (JO) called (IBCSA-BJO) to solve this problem. IBCSA-BJO includes Opposition-Based Learning, transfer functions, LÃ©vy flight, 
mutation, Xor, 1-point crossover, repairing method, and the fitness function. The 
improvement techniques were used to improve the initial population diversity, 
improve the searching capabilities and to a void the trap of local optima. Transfer 
functions was used to convert the continuous values to binary ones. Repairing
method was used to fix the infeasible solutions. The Performance of IBCSA-BJO
has been evaluated over a set of benchmark problems and shown that it can be a 
good alternative for the proposed state-of-the-art approaches.
